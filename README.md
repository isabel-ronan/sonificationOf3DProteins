Sonification of 3D Protein Structures Using Supervised Machine Learning

- This repository is created to house the code used in the development of a center-of-mass-focused protein-music algorithm.
- To run the algorithm and replicate results, please open 'oneFunctionDoesAll.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook and run the script. 
- The best MIDI files will be outputted within the Jupyter Notebook and saved to the appropriate directory.
